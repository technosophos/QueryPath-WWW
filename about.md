QueryPath is a PHP library for working with HTML and XML.

It follows the jQuery API for traversing and modifying HTML and XML
documents. Like jQuery, it uses CSS3 (and now CSS4) selectors to query
the document.

## History

QueryPath was started in 2008 by Matt Butcher. It was part of a Google
Summer of Code project, during which Emily Brand made substantial
contributions. Since then, many developers have contributed bug fixes,
enhancements, and documentation to QueryPath.

## What People Do With QueryPath

We don't maintain a list of places where QueryPath is used. But
throughout the project's history, we have heard some great use-cases for
QueryPath:

- Querying remote or local HTML documents
- Scraping old HTML and migrating it into various CMS systems
- Working with REST APIs
- Querying XML databases
- Templating with HTML templates and XML datasources
- Aggregating Atom, RSS, and XML feeds
- Performing SEO analysis on sites
- Building HTML or XML pages from code

And my personal favorite:

- Feeding external XML and HTML sources into a specially designed
application that displays the news real time on a bus system.
